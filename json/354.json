{"id":354,"title":"Monochromatic Lava Fields on Tolbachik Volcano","description":"In visible light, fresh lava flows are difficult to distinguish from the black rock of Tolbachinsky Dol, a volcanic plateau on Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula. The high altitude and northern latitude of the plateau (as far north as Moscow) preserve the barren landscape left behind by past eruptions. In contrast, the fresh lava stands out clearly against the vivid green of low-elevation meadows and forest.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/354?s=b6a36ec735e969d8a5e2d2d040388c07","created_at":"2016-03-29 12:32:18 UTC","updated_at":"2016-03-29 12:32:32 UTC","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=81296&eocn=related_to&eoci=related_image","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"WLPPR ORIGINAL","description":"All original collections from WLPPR"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
