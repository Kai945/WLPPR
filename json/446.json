{"id":446,"title":"Southern Tibetan Plateau","description":"The Tibetan Plateau was created by continental collision some 55 million years ago when the north-moving Indian Plate collided with the Eurasian Plate, causing the land to crumple and rise. And rise it did. With an average elevation exceeding 4500 m and an area of 2.5 million sq km, it is the highest and largest plateau in the world today.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/446?s=8fe4a5503adcdfe233605a25be770867","created_at":"2016-09-23 08:39:00 UTC","updated_at":"2016-09-23 08:57:15 UTC","link":"http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2016/06/Southern_Tibetan_Plateau","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"ESA","link":"http://www.esa.int","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)"},"theme":{"name":"FALSE – COLOR","description":"Satellites show what human eyes can't see"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
