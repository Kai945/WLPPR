{"id":467,"title":"Messier 104","description":"The galaxy's hallmark is a brilliant white, bulbous core encircled by the thick dust lanes comprising the spiral structure of the galaxy. As seen from Earth, the galaxy is tilted nearly edge-on. We view it from just six degrees north of its equatorial plane. This brilliant galaxy was named the Sombrero because in visible light it resembles a broad rimmed and high-topped Mexican hat.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/467?s=4d22b7f72205dd8192bf03e55eaca4c5","created_at":"2016-12-01 16:49:11 UTC","updated_at":"2016-12-07 10:52:51 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA15226","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"STScI, AURA","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"UNIVERSE","description":"All of time and space and its contents"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
