{"id":557,"title":"Unlocking an Impact Crater's Clues","description":"Mars is a dynamic planet. HiRISE has witnessed many surface changes over the past ten years, including hundreds of new craters formed by ongoing impacts. Most of these impacts are likely caused by asteroids that have strayed into collision courses with Mars. The planet’s much thinner atmosphere compared to Earth makes small asteroids less likely to burn up prior to hitting the Martian surface.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/557?s=56f133a972ca010db620b26e8f0b04da","created_at":"2018-03-26 21:43:00 UTC","updated_at":"2018-03-26 22:19:57 UTC","link":"https://www.uahirise.org/ESP_048456_1640","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"HiRISE","link":"http://www.uahirise.org","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)"},"theme":{"name":"LIFELESS","description":"Desert lands — if you value still and silent beauty of the cosmos"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
