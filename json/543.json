{"id":543,"title":"Daybreak at Gale Crater","description":"This computer-generated view depicts part of Mars at the boundary between darkness and daylight, with an area including Gale Crater beginning to catch morning light.\r\n\r\nNorthward is to the bottom. Gale is the crater with a mound inside it near the center of the image. NASA has selected Gale as the landing site for the Mars Science Laboratory mission. The mission's rover will be placed on the ground in a northern portion of Gale crater in August 2012.\r\n\r\nThis view was created using three-dimensional information from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter, which flew on NASA's Mars Global Surveyor orbiter.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/543?s=6053657adaf42cf0dd73f5c7b1c3e602","created_at":"2017-09-05 11:08:38 UTC","updated_at":"2017-09-05 11:11:26 UTC","link":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA14293","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"PLANETS","description":"All those huge things"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
