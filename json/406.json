{"id":406,"title":"Ghostly Grease Ice","description":"Ethereal swirls of grease ice appear turquoise against the midnight blue of the northern Baltic Sea near the Aland Islands (red) between Finland and Sweden. An early stage of sea ice formation, grease ice consists of a viscous mix of tiny ice crystals and resembles an oil slick on the ocean's surface. Wind and currents constantly shape and reshape grease ice into surreal, ghostly patterns.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/406?s=4750598aacfee72c16b742d82d2cbf7c","created_at":"2016-06-14 10:54:14 UTC","updated_at":"2016-06-14 10:59:14 UTC","link":"http://eros.usgs.gov/imagegallery/earth-art-3#http://eros.usgs.gov/sites/all/files/external/imagegallery/2611","copyright":"© U.S. Geological Survey (USGS, eros.usgs.gov)","copyright_details":"Landsat 7.","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"USGS","link":"https://www.usgs.gov","copyright":"© U.S. Geological Survey (USGS, eros.usgs.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"FALSE – COLOR","description":"Satellites show what human eyes can't see"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
