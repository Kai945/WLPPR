{"id":348,"title":"Night Vision","description":"It’s hard to see in the dark. However, to see what’s going on in winter, we need to look at times and places where the Sun is just barely over the horizon. \r\nThis image was taken to look at seasonal frost in gullies during southern winter on Mars, with the Sun only about two degrees over the horizon (just before sunset). To make things more difficult, the gullies are on a steep slope facing away from the sun, so they are in deep shadow.
