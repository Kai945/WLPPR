{"id":510,"title":"Starbursts in Virgo","description":"Although galaxy formation and evolution are still far from being fully understood, the conditions we see within certain galaxies — such as so-called starburst galaxies — can tell us a lot about how they have evolved over time. Starburst galaxies contain a region (or many regions) where stars are forming at such a breakneck rate that the galaxy is eating up its gas supply faster than it can be replenished!","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/510?s=d1d3dee929843b8fbca629124a8c881e","created_at":"2017-06-05 14:51:14 UTC","updated_at":"2017-06-05 15:03:05 UTC","link":"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2017/hubble-sees-starbursts-in-virgo","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"UNIVERSE","description":"All of time and space and its contents"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
