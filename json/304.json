{"id":304,"title":"A Tale of Two Hemispheres","description":"Enceladus is a world divided. To the north, the terrain is covered in impact craters, much like other icy moons. But to the south, the record of impact cratering is much more sparse, and instead the land is covered in fractures, ropy or hummocky terrain and long, linear features.\r\nLit terrain seen here is on the trailing side of Enceladus. North on Enceladus is up. The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on July 27, 2015.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/304?s=b2e609ee798bac55ef667ef244e4db52","created_at":"2016-02-03 13:23:41 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 20:49:31 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA18340","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"LIFELESS","description":"Desert lands — if you value still and silent beauty of the cosmos"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
