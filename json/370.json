{"id":370,"title":"Empty Quarter","description":"White pinpricks of cloud cast ebony shadows on the Rub' al Khali, or Empty Quarter, near the border between Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The lines of wind-sculpted sand are characteristic of immense sand deserts, or sand seas, and the Rub' al Khali is the largest desert of this type in the world. A highland ridge is just high enough to disturb the flow of the lines. In the center of that interruption lies the Saudi Arabian town of Sharurah.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/370?s=14debdb8b239768dcf9fec527d272dfa","created_at":"2016-05-04 12:24:17 UTC","updated_at":"2016-05-04 12:27:01 UTC","link":"http://eros.usgs.gov/imagegallery/earth-art-3#http://eros.usgs.gov/sites/all/files/external/imagegallery/2609","copyright":"© U.S. Geological Survey (USGS, eros.usgs.gov)","copyright_details":"NASA","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"USGS","link":"https://www.usgs.gov","copyright":"© U.S. Geological Survey (USGS, eros.usgs.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"WLPPR ORIGINAL","description":"All original collections from WLPPR"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
