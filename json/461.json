{"id":461,"title":"North America Nebula","description":"This new view of the North America nebula combines both visible and infrared light observations, taken by the Digitized Sky Survey and NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, respectively, into a single vivid picture.\r\nThe nebula is named after its resemblance to the North American continent in visible light, which in this image is represented in blue hues. Infrared light, displayed here in red and green, can penetrate deep into the dust, revealing multitudes of hidden stars and dusty clouds. Only the very densest dust clouds remain opaque, like the dark bands seen in the \"Gulf of Mexico\" area.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/461?s=73257ac2af1c9712435707c9dc27d6f1","created_at":"2016-12-01 16:24:32 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 21:00:04 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA13845","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"UNIVERSE","description":"All of time and space and its contents"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
