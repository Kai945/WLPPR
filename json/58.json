Earth-observing satellites – and in particular, high-resolution multispectral imagery – are useful for finding and monitoring natural resources like minerals.\r\n\r\nSatellites can directly identify different minerals and recognise large-scale geological structures related to mineral deposits that ground-based surveys may have difficulty detecting.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/58?s=428f20471ff6cac2336187eddac1fada","created_at":"2015-07-30 21:23:10 UTC","updated_at":"2015-12-04 23:05:25 UTC","link":"http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2012/01/Golden_curves","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)","copyright_details":"European Space Imaging (EUSI)","origin":{"name":"ESA","link":"http://www.esa.int","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)"},"theme":{"name":"WLPPR ORIGINAL","description":"All original collections from WLPPR"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
