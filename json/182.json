{"id":182,"title":"Al Jazirah, Sudan","description":"\r\nAl Jazirah (also Gezira) is one of the 26 states of Sudan. The state lies between the Blue Nile and the White Nile in the east-central region of the country. It is a well populated area suitable for agriculture. The area was at the southern end of Nubia and little is known about its ancient history and only limited archaeological work has been conducted in this area. The region has benefited from the Gezira Scheme, a program to foster cotton farming begun in 1925.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/182?s=092ecaf25a57e5a28a70a2d04a73dfc5","created_at":"2015-11-10 09:30:12 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 20:48:16 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA11079","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"GSFC/METI/ERSDAC/JAROS, and U.S./Japan ASTER Science Team.","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"MANKIND","description":"Traces of human presence on once virgin lands"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
