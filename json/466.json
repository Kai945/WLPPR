{"id":466,"title":"The Milky Way Center Aglow with Dust","description":"Our Milky Way is a dusty place. So dusty, in fact, that we cannot see the center of the galaxy in visible light. But when NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope set its infrared eyes on the galactic center, it captured this spectacular view.\r\nTaken with just one of Spitzer's cameras (at a wavelength of 8 microns), the image highlights the region's exceptionally bright and dusty clouds, lit up by young massive stars. Individual stars can also be seen as tiny dots scattered throughout the dust. The top mosaic shows a portion of the galactic center that stretches across a distance of 760 light-years.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/466?s=d4198226d4bb0b9988844273f6f3fd82","created_at":"2016-12-01 16:44:58 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 21:00:42 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA03653","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"UNIVERSE","description":"All of time and space and its contents"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
