{"id":367,"title":"The Great Divide","description":"It's difficult to get a sense of scale when viewing Saturn's rings, but the Cassini Division (seen here between the bright B ring and dimmer A ring) is almost as wide as the planet Mercury.\r\nThe 2,980-mile-wide (4,800-kilometer-wide) division in Saturn's rings is thought to be caused by the moon Mimas. Particles within the division orbit Saturn almost exactly twice for every time that Mimas orbits, leading to a build-up of gravitational nudges from the moon. These repeated gravitational interactions sculpt the outer edge of the B ring and keep its particles from drifting into the Cassini Division.\r\nThis view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 4 degrees above the ring plane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Jan. 28, 2016.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/367?s=2cf7ba59a2cce4eaff2c4f7b0f18ab49","created_at":"2016-05-04 12:16:52 UTC","updated_at":"2016-05-16 21:37:20 UTC","link":"http://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/jpl/pia18365/the-great-divide","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"LIFELESS","description":"Desert lands — if you value still and silent beauty of the cosmos"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
