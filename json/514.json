{"id":514,"title":"Her Desher Vallis","description":"These small ripples, about 10 meters apart, are located in Her Desher Vallis. Her Desher is a small channel that shows evidence of phyllosilicates—silicates with a sheet-like structure, such as clay minerals. \r\n\r\nMuch larger images of this area show that Her Desher Vallis appears isolated, with no obvious connections to craters or larger valleys. Her Desher, the ancient Egyptian name for Mars, translates to “the Red One.”","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/514?s=bd1fd524c702d48ebe57f7f5b7de6bfa","created_at":"2017-07-29 10:24:12 UTC","updated_at":"2017-07-29 11:02:06 UTC","link":"https://www.uahirise.org/ESP_020562_1550","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)","copyright_details":"Written by Kristin Block.","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"HiRISE","link":"http://www.uahirise.org","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)"},"theme":{"name":"MARS","description":"The Red Planet, one of the most desirable destinations for humanity"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
