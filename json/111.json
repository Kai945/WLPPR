{"id":111,"title":"Yardang-Sculpted Deposits","description":"We see here a terrain with an incredible morphologic dichotomy: a relatively smooth region that transitions into sharp ridges. These ridges, aligned in the nearly same direction, are called yardangs. Yardangs are not unique to Mars. Many yardangs can be found on Earth, in very dry regions with strong prevailing winds.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/111?s=5a74535f631990576e05a1db2c79707e","created_at":"2015-09-03 15:46:58 UTC","updated_at":"2015-12-04 23:05:26 UTC","link":"http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_041929_1675","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)","copyright_details":"","origin":{"name":"HiRISE","link":"http://www.uahirise.org","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)"},"theme":{"name":"MARS","description":"The Red Planet, one of the most desirable destinations for humanity"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
