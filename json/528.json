{"id":528,"title":"Pluto","description":"NASA's New Horizons spacecraft captured this high-resolution enhanced color view of Pluto on July 14, 2015. The image combines blue, red and infrared images taken by the Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera (MVIC). Pluto's surface sports a remarkable range of subtle colors, enhanced in this view to a rainbow of pale blues, yellows, oranges, and deep reds. Many landforms have their own distinct colors, telling a complex geological and climatological story that scientists have only just begun to decode.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/528?s=d0fbd7d52518e2edc62d56a568478e8b","created_at":"2017-09-05 09:45:01 UTC","updated_at":"2017-09-05 09:45:01 UTC","link":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA19952","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"PLANETS","description":"All those huge things"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
