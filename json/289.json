{"id":289,"title":"Crescent Tethys and Rings","description":"Tethys, dwarfed by the scale of Saturn and its rings, appears as an elegant crescent in this image taken by NASA's Cassini Spacecraft. Views like this are impossible from Earth, where we only see Saturn's moons as (more or less) fully illuminated disks.\r\nThe region of Saturn seen at left is on the planet's night side. Reflected light from the rings dimly illuminates the planet's northern hemisphere.\r\nThis view looks toward the anti-Saturn side of Tethys. North on Tethys is up and rotated 24 degrees to the left. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Aug. 18, 2015.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/289?s=0ff98b53f3644b9d899512a744853a45","created_at":"2016-01-19 10:58:36 UTC","updated_at":"2016-01-19 10:59:56 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA18348","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"LIFELESS","description":"Desert lands — if you value still and silent beauty of the cosmos"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
