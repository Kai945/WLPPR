{"id":635,"title":"Avalanche Season","description":"Every spring the sun shines on the side of the stack of layers at the North Pole of Mars known as the north polar layered deposits. The warmth destabilizes the ice and blocks break loose.\r\n\r\nWhen they reach the bottom of the more than 500 meter tall cliff face, the blocks kick up a cloud of dust. (In the cutout, the top layer of the north polar cap is to the lower left.) The layers beneath are different colors and textures depending on the amount of dust mixed with ice.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/635?s=be662ef9c88237eefc125969bc02ccf3","created_at":"2019-10-15 15:59:15 UTC","updated_at":"2019-10-15 16:02:24 UTC","link":"https://www.uahirise.org/ESP_060176_2640","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"HiRISE","link":"http://www.uahirise.org","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)"},"theme":{"name":"MARS","description":"The Red Planet, one of the most desirable destinations for humanity"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
