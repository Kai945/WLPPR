{"id":504,"title":"Juventae Chasma","description":"There are many hills about 1 kilometer high in Juventae Chasma, which is located north of the main Valles Marineris canyon system. The floor of the canyon is covered by a sea of sand, but the hills rise above the sand.\r\n\r\nA few adventuresome sand dunes have slowly climbed up on the hills, like that near the upper left of the enhanced-color cutout. The color diversity here is exceptional, due to varying mineral compositions and good exposures.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/504?s=646a14a90b9de1d070662fe7afe393b2","created_at":"2017-06-05 14:33:07 UTC","updated_at":"2017-06-05 15:01:27 UTC","link":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA21567","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"MARS","description":"The Red Planet, one of the most desirable destinations for humanity"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
