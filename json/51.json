{"id":51,"title":"Sahara desert, Algeria","description":"The heat and lack of water render vast desert areas highly unwelcoming, making satellites the best way to observe and monitor these environments on a large scale.\r\n\r\nSatellites provide information on desert ecosystems and their expansion, and about areas at risk of soil degradation, erosion and desertification. Data from spaceborne sensors also assist in the water management of inhabited arid regions, and can track and help predict the movement of dust storms.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/51?s=8de7bb0df1a98fe498af95cd39182467","created_at":"2015-07-30 21:13:23 UTC","updated_at":"2015-12-04 23:05:25 UTC","link":"http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2014/11/Sahara_desert_Algeria","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)","copyright_details":"JAXA.","origin":{"name":"ESA","link":"http://www.esa.int","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)"},"theme":{"name":"WLPPR ORIGINAL","description":"All original collections from WLPPR"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
