{"id":229,"title":"North Dakota Floods","description":"The Spring, 2009 floods along the Red River between North Dakota and Minnesota continue to affect cities in the two states, especially Fargo and Whitehead. This satellite image, acquired April 9, 2009, shows the flood waters north of the towns spilling over into farmlands. Residents were on constant flood alert, filling sandbags, and hoping that the water level would finally recede. Standing water appears in shades of dark green and brown, wet ground is dark grey, and snow is white.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/229?s=b41317c1f6cf9af8d0e6326c84cfb917","created_at":"2015-12-01 11:20:16 UTC","updated_at":"2015-12-04 23:05:26 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA11989","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"GSFC/METI/ERSDAC/JAROS, and U.S./Japan ASTER Science Team.","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"WINTER","description":"Special gallery to set the mood for snowy days"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
