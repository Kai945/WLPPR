{"id":509,"title":"Lines of Foam on Garabogazköl","description":"The next time you are out on the water in a boat or surfboard, keep an eye out for long filaments of foam and debris floating at the surface. This common phenomenon—usually the product of natural decomposition processes and wind—can be quite eye-catching from the surface or from space.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, foam is the product of decaying bits of aquatic plants, algae, phytoplankton, or other microorganisms. The decomposition process releases oils and other substances called surfactants that rise up and reduce the surface tension of the water—making it easier for bubbles to form in windy conditions. (In addition to these natural sources, detergents and other manmade pollutants can act as surfactants.)","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/509?s=5ed6c96a9e38c09f520ecdc431d71a03","created_at":"2017-06-05 14:49:51 UTC","updated_at":"2017-06-05 15:02:14 UTC","link":"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=90206","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"WATER","description":"Something special that holds all life together"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
