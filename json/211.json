{"id":211,"title":"Elysium Planitia region of Mars","description":"This image shows an impact crater that was cut by lava in the Elysium Planitia region of Mars. The relatively flat, shallow floor, rough surface texture, and possible cooling cracks seem to indicate that the crater was partially filled with lava. The northern part of the image also shows a more extensive lava flow deposit that surrounds the impact ejecta of the largest impact crater in the image.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/211?s=8741e11c4326f0b300d35784f80965a1","created_at":"2015-11-23 12:14:25 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 20:51:44 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA18887","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"LIFELESS","description":"Desert lands — if you value still and silent beauty of the cosmos"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
