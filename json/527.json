{"id":527,"title":"Pluto's Blue Sky","description":"\r\nPluto's haze layer shows its blue color in this picture taken by the New Horizons Ralph/Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC). The high-altitude haze is thought to be similar in nature to that seen at Saturn's moon Titan. The source of both hazes likely involves sunlight-initiated chemical reactions of nitrogen and methane, leading to relatively small, soot-like particles (called tholins) that grow as they settle toward the surface. This image was generated by software that combines information from blue, red and near-infrared images to replicate the color a human eye would perceive as closely as possible.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/527?s=10845f518f7836c1521bc8285039a208","created_at":"2017-09-05 09:42:14 UTC","updated_at":"2017-09-05 11:11:04 UTC","link":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA19964","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"PLANETS","description":"All those huge things"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
