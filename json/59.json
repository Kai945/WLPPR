{"id":59,"title":"Algerian Sahara","description":"The region is known as ‘land of terror’ because of its lack of water and vegetation. As visible, this region is characterised by dark sandstone hills, steep canyon walls, salt flats (white), stone plateaus, sandstone outcrop patterns of concentric loops and sprawling seas of multi-storey sand dunes known as 'ergs'. Erg Mehedjibat, which appears as a yellow bouquet of flowers (upper right), is made up of a cluster of small star dunes that grow upward rather than laterally.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/59?s=9d212aa9ef3b396baa0dda9a13fd8777","created_at":"2015-07-30 21:23:56 UTC","updated_at":"2015-12-04 23:05:25 UTC","link":"http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2009/10/Algerian_Sahara","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)","copyright_details":"JAXA.","origin":{"name":"ESA","link":"http://www.esa.int","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)"},"theme":{"name":"WLPPR ORIGINAL","description":"All original collections from WLPPR"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
