{"id":282,"title":"Layers and Fractures in Ophir Chasma","description":"Ophir Chasma forms the northern portion of Valles Marineris, and this image features a small part of its wall and floor.\r\n\r\nThe wall rock shows many sedimentary layers and the floor is covered with wind-blown ridges, which are intermediate in size between sand ripples and sand dunes. Rocks protruding on the floor could be volcanic intrusions of once-molten magma that have pushed aside the surrounding sedimentary layers and \"froze\" in place.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/282?s=0f3c5b7c37f1175229cea98ba04f71c5","created_at":"2015-12-17 11:39:27 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 20:38:44 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA20044","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"MARS","description":"The Red Planet, one of the most desirable destinations for humanity"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
