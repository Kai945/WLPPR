{"id":521,"title":"Wind Carved Rock","description":"Mars. The distinctively fluted surface and elongated hills in this image in Medusae Fossae are caused by wind erosion of a soft fine-grained rock. Called yardangs, these features are aligned with the prevailing wind direction. This wind direction would have dominated for a very long time to carve these large-scale features into the exposed rock we see today.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/521?s=a1d44a38d61a4352b1f0bb2d121cbcf3","created_at":"2017-07-29 10:49:21 UTC","updated_at":"2017-07-29 10:57:14 UTC","link":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA21111","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"SIMPLE","description":"The beauty in the minimalist expressions of our planet"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
