{"id":548,"title":"Hurricane Irma","description":"The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi NPP satellite captured a nighttime view of the storm at 1:35 a.m. local time (05:35 Universal Time) on September 6 as the eye was over the island of Barbuda. The image was acquired by the VIIRS “day-night band,” which detects light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared and uses filtering techniques to observe signals such as city lights, auroras, wildfires, and reflected moonlight. In this case, the clouds were lit by the full Moon. The image is a composite, showing storm imagery combined with VIIRS imagery of city lights.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/548?s=6fe1675f4b5f2355055c5ddbb0e13a2c","created_at":"2017-12-05 09:09:15 UTC","updated_at":"2017-12-05 09:25:28 UTC","link":"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=90912","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"WLPPR ORIGINAL","description":"All original collections from WLPPR"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
