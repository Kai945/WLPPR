{"id":242,"title":"Astrolabe Glacier and Unbalanced Ice","description":"Located in the Terre Adélie-George V Land section of East Antarctica, Astrolabe Glacier streams out from the interior of Antarctica to dump ice into the sea. This outlet glacier is estimated to be 10 kilometers (6 miles) wide, and the drainage basin that feeds it stretches as much as 200 kilometers (120 miles) inland. Astrolabe is named for the flagship of Captain Jules Dumont d’Urville’s 19th century expedition to Antarctica.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/242?s=1b80e3ce10706b5079006ca6417bccdc","created_at":"2015-12-01 11:38:20 UTC","updated_at":"2015-12-04 23:05:26 UTC","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=49860","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"WINTER","description":"Special gallery to set the mood for snowy days"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
