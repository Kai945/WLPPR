{"id":539,"title":"Saturn's shadow","description":"The projection of Saturn's shadow on the rings grows shorter as Saturn's season advances toward northern summer, thanks to the planet's permanent tilt as it orbits the sun. This will continue until Saturn's solstice in May 2017. At that point in time, the shadow will extend only as far as the innermost A ring, leaving the middle and outer A ring completely free of the planet's shadow.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/539?s=a42de3c3b1f0e97d65387d70ad1d4b06","created_at":"2017-09-05 10:50:24 UTC","updated_at":"2017-09-05 11:11:15 UTC","link":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA21328","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"PLANETS","description":"All those huge things"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
