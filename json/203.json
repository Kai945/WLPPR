{"id":203,"title":"Bizarre TARs","description":"These strange features in Syria Planum are still being widely debated. They have the same general form as transverse aeolian ridges (TARs) elsewhere on Mars; windblown deposits that are common in the Martian tropics. Their height and spacing are similar to the more familiar looking TARs in other places, and they are similarly bright. Unless Nature is perverse, they were both made by the same process.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/203?s=f9445923d3826d782c2374aa3b9d856c","created_at":"2015-11-23 12:04:52 UTC","updated_at":"2016-03-30 09:23:15 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA19942","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"HiRISE","link":"http://www.uahirise.org","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)"},"theme":{"name":"LIFELESS","description":"Desert lands — if you value still and silent beauty of the cosmos"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
