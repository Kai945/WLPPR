{"id":459,"title":"Orion Nebula","description":"The image shows the Orion nebula, a happening place where stars are born. The young stars dip and peak in brightness due to a variety of reasons. Shifting cold and hot spots on the stars' surfaces cause brightness levels to change, in addition to surrounding disks of lumpy planet-forming material, which can obstruct starlight. Spitzer is keeping tabs on the young stars, providing data on their changing ways.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/459?s=a308b7ee577c0826dc13146352965df3","created_at":"2016-12-01 16:16:34 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 20:59:55 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA13005","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"UNIVERSE","description":"All of time and space and its contents"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
