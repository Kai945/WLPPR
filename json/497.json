{"id":497,"title":"Veiled Worlds","description":"Titan and Saturn have few things in common, but a hazy, clouded appearance is one feature they share. Although their faces seem similar in images like this, appearances can be misleading.\r\n\r\nBoth Saturn and Titan have thick atmospheres, in a relative sense. But Saturn is a gas giant, covered in clouds, with no solid surface to speak of. Titan's atmosphere is a blanket of dense haze -- a photochemical smog -- surrounding an icy, solid body. Even their atmospheric compositions are different; Saturn is mostly hydrogen and helium with clouds of water, ammonia and ammonium hydrosulfide. Titan's atmosphere is primarily nitrogen and methane, with occasional methane clouds.\r\n\r\nThis view looks toward Saturn from the unilluminated side of the rings, 0.3 degrees below the ring plane. The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on May 22, 2015.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/497?s=8d6c6d9de5e4555161078b1abbcba562","created_at":"2017-04-13 17:07:04 UTC","updated_at":"2017-09-05 11:15:21 UTC","link":"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/resources/6245/?category=images","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"PLANETS","description":"All those huge things"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
