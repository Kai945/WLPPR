{"id":191,"title":"Day Fire in Ventura County","description":"The Day fire has been burning in Ventura County in Southern California since Labor Day, and has consumed more than 160,000 acres. As of September 29, it was 63 percent contained. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer on NASA's Terra satellite flew over the fire at 10 p.m. Pacific Time on September 28, and imaged the fire with its infrared camera. The hottest areas of active burning appear as red spots (check it on NASA's page) on the image.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/191?s=d2d487bc5c4d2cf45f8d9c8929ec855b","created_at":"2015-11-17 10:20:35 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 20:42:40 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA08790","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"GSFC/METI/ERSDAC/JAROS, and U.S./Japan ASTER Science Team","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"FALSE – COLOR","description":"Satellites show what human eyes can't see"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
