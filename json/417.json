{"id":417,"title":"Icelandic Tiger","description":"This stretch of Iceland's northern coast resembles a tiger's head complete with stripes of orange, black, and white. The tiger's mouth is the great Eyjafjorour, a deep fjord that juts into the mainland between steep mountains. The name means \"island fjord,\" derived from the tiny, tear-shaped Hrisey Island near its mouth. The ice-free port city of Akureyri lies near the fjord's narrow tip, and is Iceland's second largest population center after the capital, Reykjavik.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/417?s=e17bdd594bcc9e4bbc80e8d53249a4fe","created_at":"2016-08-03 09:34:41 UTC","updated_at":"2016-08-03 09:41:44 UTC","link":"http://eros.usgs.gov/imagegallery/earth-art-3#http://eros.usgs.gov/sites/all/files/external/imagegallery/2615","copyright":"© U.S. Geological Survey (USGS, eros.usgs.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"USGS","link":"https://www.usgs.gov","copyright":"© U.S. Geological Survey (USGS, eros.usgs.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"WLPPR ORIGINAL","description":"All original collections from WLPPR"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
