{"id":89,"title":"Bushfire Burn Scar near Dunalley, Tasmania","description":"In January 2013, intense bushfires blazed in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. One of the hardest hit towns was Dunalley, a fishing village on the eastern coast. A blaze destroyed at least 80 homes—about 30 percent of the town— when it tore through the area on January 4, 2013. In the nearby village of Connellys Marsh, 40 percent of the buildings were destroyed. Primrose Sands lost several homes as well.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/89?s=5b38bd6f56445ced2a9ec8da15efd3f0","created_at":"2015-08-18 23:24:44 UTC","updated_at":"2016-05-16 21:35:35 UTC","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=80252","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"GSFC/METI/ERSDAC/JAROS, and U.S./Japan ASTER Science Team.","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"FALSE – COLOR","description":"Satellites show what human eyes can't see"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
