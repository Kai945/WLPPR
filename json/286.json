{"id":286,"title":"Ugab River, Namibia","description":"The Ugab River is an ephemeral river that only flows above the surface of its sandy bed a few days each year, but even during much of the dry season its subterranean water surfaces as pools in places, and provides an important resource for species in the Damaraland region of northern Namibia. The Ugab's mean run-off is roughly 20 million cubic metres per annum.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/286?s=59ddd9ba0eb68bb555769b28d82af4a8","created_at":"2016-01-19 10:46:15 UTC","updated_at":"2016-03-30 09:11:08 UTC","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=87227","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"GSFC/METI/ERSDAC/JAROS, and U.S./Japan ASTER Science Team.","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"FALSE – COLOR","description":"Satellites show what human eyes can't see"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
