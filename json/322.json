{"id":322,"title":" Salt Ponds, United States","description":"These bright pond pockets of red and green are caused by the organisms or micro-algae living within them. The microorganisms located in each pond are determined by their tolerance to salinity, and the colors are reactions to salt levels. The evaporation ponds cover an array of hues from bright green, where low salinity encourages green algae to thrive, to a deep coral pink or red hue that is caused by the algae Dunaliella, producing a red pigment in response to high salt content. A high number of tiny brine shrimp cast an orange sheen to the ponds that are considered mid-salinity. Weather can effect the colors as well, but their ever-changing pigments always stand out from the sky, and have served as a visual marker for astronauts.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/322?s=fe8b96c19a8f25a982d0d59a880f9cf2","created_at":"2016-03-22 11:31:03 UTC","updated_at":"2016-03-22 11:33:26 UTC","link":"http://www.si-imaging.com/ds4_1_1.html?db=gal_bbs2&no=203&c=view&page=1&SK=&SN=&idx=","copyright":"© SI Imaging Services (SIIS, KARI, si-imaging.com)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"SIIS","link":"http://si-imaging.com","copyright":"© SI Imaging Services (SIIS, KARI, si-imaging.com)"},"theme":{"name":"MANKIND","description":"Traces of human presence on once virgin lands"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
