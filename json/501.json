{"id":501,"title":"Turquoise Tendrils","description":"Natural-color image of what appears to be a phytoplankton bloom off the coast of Tunisia. It is also possible that the discoloration is from sediment. Upwelling of deeper, nutrient-rich waters can cause such blooms, which provide marine life with a source of food. Other times they are fueled by nutrient runoff from rivers and coastal waterways. Most blooms are benign, but some can become harmful when they consume too much of the oxygen in the water or when the phytoplankton species are toxic.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/501?s=8ac82640e61d47cd5015cfdff402127d","created_at":"2017-04-13 17:26:17 UTC","updated_at":"2017-04-13 17:40:43 UTC","link":"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=89878","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"WATER","description":"Something special that holds all life together"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
