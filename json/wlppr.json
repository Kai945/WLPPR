The lake is mostly inhospitable to life, except for a few species adapted to its warm, salty, and alkaline water.\r\n\r\nBut you don’t need to visit the lake in person to see its stunning, seasonal color. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 captured these natural-color images of Lake Natron and its surroundings. They show the lake on March 6, 2017, very early in the rainy season that runs from March to May. In these images, you can see the deepest water along the perimeter of the lake bed, the location of lower-elevation lagoons.\r\n\r\nThe climate here is arid. In a non-El Niño year, the lake receives less than 500 millimeters (20 inches) of rain. Evaporation usually exceeds that amount, so the lake relies on other sources—such as the Ewaso Ng’iro River at the north end—to maintain a supply of water through the dry season.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/507?s=7c56d06431cfb098e8c291822ed04d7d","created_at":"2017-06-05 14:39:02 UTC","updated_at":"2017-06-05 15:01:01 UTC","link":"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=90191","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","theme_ids":[2],"origin":{"id":2,"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"images":{"original":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/507/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/507/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/507/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/507/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"parallax":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4_parallax/507/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5_parallax/507/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6_parallax/507/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus_parallax/507/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"original_low_quality":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/507/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/507/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/507/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/507/original_low_quality.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"preview":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/507/aspect_50.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/507/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/507/preview.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/507/preview.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/507/preview.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/507/preview.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"small":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/507/aspect_100.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/507/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/507/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/507/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/507/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/507/aspect_100.jpg","iPad":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/507/aspect_100.jpg","iPad_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/507/aspect_100.jpg"}}},{"id":499,"title":"Antarctic Sea Ice is Lean and Green","description":"It may look like someone dyed the water green for St. Patrick’s Day, but the green hue visible off the coast of Antarctica is entirely natural.

An endemic species of fish, the alkaline tilapia, lives along the edges of the hotspring inlets, and the lake actually derives its color from salt-loving microorganisms that thrive in its alkaline waters. Spirulina, a blue-green algae with red pigments, passes its pigments along to the Lesser Flamingoes that feed on the algae and raise their young here.\r\nThis image simulates natural color, showing where the salt-loving microorganisms have colored the lake’s salt crust red or pink. The salt crust changes over time, giving the lake a slightly different appearance each time it is photographed by astronauts or imaged by satellites.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/321?s=dc8bf965f9571cf855cc7657a9cf22d6","created_at":"2016-03-22 11:27:37 UTC","updated_at":"2016-03-22 11:33:03 UTC","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=5465&eocn=related_to&eoci=related_image","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"GSFC/METI/ERSDAC/JAROS, and U.S./Japan ASTER Science Team.","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","theme_ids":[2],"origin":{"id":2,"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"images":{"original":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/321/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/321/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/321/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/321/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"parallax":{"iPhone4":null,"iPhone5":null,"iPhone6":null,"iPhone6Plus":null,"iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"original_low_quality":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/321/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/321/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/321/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/321/original_low_quality.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"preview":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/321/aspect_50.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/321/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/321/preview.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/321/preview.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/321/preview.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/321/preview.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"small":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/321/aspect_100.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/321/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/321/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/321/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/321/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/321/aspect_100.jpg","iPad":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/321/aspect_100.jpg","iPad_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/321/aspect_100.jpg"}}},{"id":314,"title":"Quesm Siwah","description":"Matrouh Governorate is one of the governorates of Egypt.

The constellation of Orion is prominent in the evening sky throughout the world from about December through April of each year. The nebula (also catalogued as Messier 42) is located in the sword of Orion, hanging from his famous belt of three stars. The star cluster embedded in the nebula is visible to the unaided human eye as a single star, with some fuzziness apparent to the most keen-eyed observers. Because of its prominence, cultures all around the world have given special significance to Orion. The Maya of Mesoamerica envision the lower portion of Orion, his belt and feet (the stars Saiph and Rigel), as being the hearthstones of creation, similar to the triangular three-stone hearth that is at the center of all traditional Maya homes. The Orion nebula, lying at the center of the triangle, is interpreted by the Maya as the cosmic fire of creation surrounded by smoke.\r\nRead more on link below.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/457?s=932259a3db27aa434811982a28b95279","created_at":"2016-12-01 16:07:05 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 20:59:45 UTC","link":"","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"UCLA","follow_name":"","follow_link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA16684","theme_ids":[10],"origin":{"id":7,"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"images":{"original":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/457/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/457/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/457/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/457/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"parallax":{"iPhone4":null,"iPhone5":null,"iPhone6":null,"iPhone6Plus":null,"iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"original_low_quality":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/457/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/457/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/457/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/457/original_low_quality.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"preview":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/457/aspect_50.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/457/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/457/preview.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/457/preview.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/457/preview.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/457/preview.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"small":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/457/aspect_100.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/457/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/457/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/457/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/457/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/457/aspect_100.jpg","iPad":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/457/aspect_100.jpg","iPad_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/457/aspect_100.jpg"}}},{"id":458,"title":"Horsehead Nebula","description":"Looking like an apparition rising from whitecaps of interstellar foam, the iconic Horsehead Nebula has graced astronomy books ever since its discovery over a century ago.

These stars illuminate the cloud, creating the beautiful nebulosity, or swirls of material, seen here in infrared.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/460?s=d4b220785a118f08d1573776d0cc4847","created_at":"2016-12-01 16:21:27 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 21:00:00 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA08653","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"Univ. of Toledo","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","theme_ids":[10],"origin":{"id":7,"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"images":{"original":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/460/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/460/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/460/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/460/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"parallax":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4_parallax/460/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5_parallax/460/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6_parallax/460/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus_parallax/460/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"original_low_quality":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/460/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/460/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/460/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/460/original_low_quality.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"preview":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/460/aspect_50.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/460/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/460/preview.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/460/preview.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/460/preview.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/460/preview.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"small":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/460/aspect_100.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/460/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/460/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/460/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/460/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/460/aspect_100.jpg","iPad":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/460/aspect_100.jpg","iPad_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/460/aspect_100.jpg"}}},{"id":461,"title":"North America Nebula","description":"This new view of the North America nebula combines both visible and infrared light observations, taken by the Digitized Sky Survey and NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, respectively, into a single vivid picture.\r\nThe nebula is named after its resemblance to the North American continent in visible light, which in this image is represented in blue hues.

The top mosaic shows a portion of the galactic center that stretches across a distance of 760 light-years.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/466?s=d4198226d4bb0b9988844273f6f3fd82","created_at":"2016-12-01 16:44:58 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 21:00:42 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA03653","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","theme_ids":[10],"origin":{"id":7,"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"images":{"original":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/466/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/466/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/466/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/466/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"parallax":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4_parallax/466/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5_parallax/466/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6_parallax/466/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus_parallax/466/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"original_low_quality":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/466/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/466/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/466/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/466/original_low_quality.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"preview":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/466/aspect_50.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/466/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/466/preview.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/466/preview.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/466/preview.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/466/preview.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"small":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/466/aspect_100.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/466/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/466/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/466/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/466/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/466/aspect_100.jpg","iPad":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/466/aspect_100.jpg","iPad_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/466/aspect_100.jpg"}}},{"id":467,"title":"Messier 104","description":"The galaxy's hallmark is a brilliant white, bulbous core encircled by the thick dust lanes comprising the spiral structure of the galaxy.

These are recognizable by their spiral arms, which fan out not from a circular core, but from an elongated bar cutting through the galaxy’s center. Our home galaxy, the Milky Way, is also a barred spiral galaxy. NGC 7640 might not look much like a spiral in this image, but this is due to the orientation of the galaxy with respect to Earth — or to Hubble, which acted as photographer in this case! We often do not see galaxies face on, which can make features such as spiral arms less obvious.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/494?s=c83c57fc45c40c085e076e7a17902862","created_at":"2017-02-21 09:50:40 UTC","updated_at":"2017-09-06 13:14:10 UTC","link":"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2017/hubble-sees-spiral-in-andromeda","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"ESA, Hubble","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","theme_ids":[10],"origin":{"id":2,"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"images":{"original":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/494/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/494/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/494/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/494/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"parallax":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4_parallax/494/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5_parallax/494/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6_parallax/494/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus_parallax/494/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"original_low_quality":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/494/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/494/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/494/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/494/original_low_quality.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"preview":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/494/aspect_50.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/494/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/494/preview.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/494/preview.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/494/preview.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/494/preview.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"small":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/494/aspect_100.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/494/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/494/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/494/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/494/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/494/aspect_100.jpg","iPad":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/494/aspect_100.jpg","iPad_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/494/aspect_100.jpg"}}},{"id":470,"title":"Eta Carinae","description":"The bright star at the center of the nebula is Eta Carinae, one of the most massive stars in the galaxy.

The moon's apparent reversal is caused by SDO first overtaking the moon in its orbit, then the moon catching up as SDO swings around Earth's dusk side. During the transit the Sun moves in the frame as the telescopes cool and flex in the lunar shadow.

Areas where the sea surface is smoother reflect more sunlight directly back to the satellite’s imager. In contrast, areas of rougher water appear darker because light is scattered in many more directions.\r\nDry, cool winds from the north, called the Etesian winds, are common over the Aegean Sea during summer. On the windward side of the islands, those winds pile up the water and disturb the surface. But as those air masses run into the islands and their rocky peaks, a “wind shadow” with much calmer winds (and seas) form on the leeward side of islands (in this case, the south sides). Darker areas amid the bright streaks could be the result of wind or water turbulence, or perhaps breaks in the wind-blocking land topography.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/550?s=3cec9fdfd20602b10a4e8db435322a46","created_at":"2017-12-05 09:13:13 UTC","updated_at":"2017-12-05 09:27:40 UTC","link":"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=90532","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","theme_ids":[7],"origin":{"id":2,"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"images":{"original":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/550/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/550/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/550/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/550/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"parallax":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4_parallax/550/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5_parallax/550/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6_parallax/550/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus_parallax/550/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"original_low_quality":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/550/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/550/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/550/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/550/original_low_quality.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"preview":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/550/aspect_50.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/550/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/550/preview.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/550/preview.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/550/preview.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/550/preview.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"small":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/550/aspect_100.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/550/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/550/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/550/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/550/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/550/aspect_100.jpg","iPad":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/550/aspect_100.jpg","iPad_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/550/aspect_100.jpg"}}},{"id":520,"title":"Mono Lake, California","description":"In eastern California, along the western edge of the Great Basin, sits Mono Lake.

Now surrounded by mountain ranges, however, Mono Lake has no outlet; water entering the lake can only evaporate away, so Mono Lake is saltier than the ocean. South of the lake appear some of the geologic features known as Mono Craters.

Waves in the Sky off of Africa","description":"Off of west Africa, dry air coming off the Namib desert—after being cooled by the night—moves out under the balmy, moist air over the ocean and bumps it upwards. As the humid air rises to a higher altitude, the moisture condenses into droplets, forming clouds. Gravity rolls these newly formed clouds into a wave-like shape. When moist air goes up, it cools, and then gravity pushes it down again. As it plummets toward the earth, the moist air is pushed up again by the dry air. Repeated again and again, this process creates gravity waves.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/441?s=271dcb1b153fc7d9ceba1352e841e938","created_at":"2016-08-29 09:39:42 UTC","updated_at":"2016-08-29 09:42:50 UTC","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=88296","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","theme_ids":[7],"origin":{"id":2,"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"images":{"original":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/441/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/441/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/441/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/441/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"parallax":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4_parallax/441/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5_parallax/441/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6_parallax/441/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus_parallax/441/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"original_low_quality":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/441/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/441/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/441/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/441/original_low_quality.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"preview":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/441/aspect_50.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/441/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/441/preview.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/441/preview.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/441/preview.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/441/preview.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"small":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/441/aspect_100.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/441/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/441/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/441/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/441/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/441/aspect_100.jpg","iPad":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/441/aspect_100.jpg","iPad_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/441/aspect_100.jpg"}}},{"id":419,"title":"Ice Scours the North Caspian Sea","description":"In early April 2016, ocean scientist Norman Kuring of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center found a puzzling image that showed lines crisscrossing the North Caspian Sea.

Long before European settlers arrived in Australia, the indigenous Tiwi people inhabited this region near Australia’s northern coast, subsisting off of a highly unique ecosystem. Because of the area’s high rainfall and isolation, the islands boast species of flora and fauna not found elsewhere in the world, in addition to eucalyptus forests, which will likely be the future of Tiwi’s forestry industry.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/333?s=c25b819c2c50ae33e33f65330c0e120f","created_at":"2016-03-29 11:09:30 UTC","updated_at":"2016-03-29 11:09:30 UTC","link":"http://gallery.urthecast.com/bathurst-island-and-melville-island","copyright":"© UrtheCast Corp.

North of these, a bright cloud band similar to the south polar streak may be seen.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/534?s=045619d5acb32531874c152a5e0cfe30","created_at":"2017-09-05 10:14:52 UTC","updated_at":"2017-09-06 09:24:43 UTC","link":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA01492","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","theme_ids":[11],"origin":{"id":7,"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"images":{"original":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/534/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/534/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/534/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/534/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"parallax":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4_parallax/534/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5_parallax/534/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6_parallax/534/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus_parallax/534/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"original_low_quality":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/534/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/534/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/534/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/534/original_low_quality.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"preview":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/534/aspect_50.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/534/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/534/preview.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/534/preview.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/534/preview.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/534/preview.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"small":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/534/aspect_100.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/534/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/534/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/534/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/534/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/534/aspect_100.jpg","iPad":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/534/aspect_100.jpg","iPad_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/534/aspect_100.jpg"}}},{"id":541,"title":"Ceres","description":"Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt that lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

Although their faces seem similar in images like this, appearances can be misleading.\r\n\r\nBoth Saturn and Titan have thick atmospheres, in a relative sense. But Saturn is a gas giant, covered in clouds, with no solid surface to speak of. Titan's atmosphere is a blanket of dense haze -- a photochemical smog -- surrounding an icy, solid body. Even their atmospheric compositions are different; Saturn is mostly hydrogen and helium with clouds of water, ammonia and ammonium hydrosulfide. Titan's atmosphere is primarily nitrogen and methane, with occasional methane clouds.\r\n\r\nThis view looks toward Saturn from the unilluminated side of the rings, 0.3 degrees below the ring plane. The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on May 22, 2015.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/497?s=8d6c6d9de5e4555161078b1abbcba562","created_at":"2017-04-13 17:07:04 UTC","updated_at":"2017-09-05 11:15:21 UTC","link":"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/resources/6245/?category=images","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","theme_ids":[11],"origin":{"id":7,"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"images":{"original":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/497/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/497/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/497/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/497/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"parallax":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4_parallax/497/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5_parallax/497/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6_parallax/497/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus_parallax/497/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"original_low_quality":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/497/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/497/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/497/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/497/original_low_quality.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"preview":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/497/aspect_50.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/497/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/497/preview.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/497/preview.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/497/preview.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/497/preview.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"small":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/497/aspect_100.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/497/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/497/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/497/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/497/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/497/aspect_100.jpg","iPad":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/497/aspect_100.jpg","iPad_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/497/aspect_100.jpg"}}},{"id":531,"title":"Mercury","description":"This mosaic shows the planet Mercury as seen by Mariner 10 as it sped away from the planet on March 29, 1974. The mosaic was made from over 140 individual TV frames taken about two hours after encounter, at a range of 37,300 miles (60,000 kilometers). North is at top. The limb is at right, as is the illuminating sunlight. The equator crosses the planet about two-thirds of the way from the top of the disc. The terminator, line-separating day from night, is about 190 degrees west longitude. The planet shows a gibbous disc-more than half-illuminated. This hemisphere is dominated by smooth plains, rather than heavily cratered terrain, and resembles portions of the Moon's maria in general shape. Half of a very large, multi-ringed basin named Caloris Basin appears near the center of the disc near the terminator. Its surrounding mountain ring is 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) in diameter.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/531?s=44931cc1437e7d6c940de51e6037241d","created_at":"2017-09-05 09:53:18 UTC","updated_at":"2017-09-06 09:39:51 UTC","link":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA02418","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","theme_ids":[11],"origin":{"id":7,"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"images":{"original":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/531/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/531/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/531/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/531/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"parallax":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4_parallax/531/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5_parallax/531/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6_parallax/531/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus_parallax/531/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"original_low_quality":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/531/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/531/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/531/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/531/original_low_quality.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"preview":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/531/aspect_50.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/531/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/531/preview.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/531/preview.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/531/preview.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/531/preview.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"small":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/531/aspect_100.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/531/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/531/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/531/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/531/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/531/aspect_100.jpg","iPad":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/531/aspect_100.jpg","iPad_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/531/aspect_100.jpg"}}},{"id":530,"title":"The Rich Color Variations of Pluto","description":"NASA's New Horizons spacecraft captured this high-resolution enhanced color view of Pluto on July 14, 2015.

The microorganisms located in each pond are determined by their tolerance to salinity, and the colors are reactions to salt levels. The evaporation ponds cover an array of hues from bright green, where low salinity encourages green algae to thrive, to a deep coral pink or red hue that is caused by the algae Dunaliella, producing a red pigment in response to high salt content. A high number of tiny brine shrimp cast an orange sheen to the ponds that are considered mid-salinity. Weather can effect the colors as well, but their ever-changing pigments always stand out from the sky, and have served as a visual marker for astronauts.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/322?s=fe8b96c19a8f25a982d0d59a880f9cf2","created_at":"2016-03-22 11:31:03 UTC","updated_at":"2016-03-22 11:33:26 UTC","link":"http://www.si-imaging.com/ds4_1_1.html?db=gal_bbs2&no=203&c=view&page=1&SK=&SN=&idx=","copyright":"© SI Imaging Services (SIIS, KARI, si-imaging.com)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","theme_ids":[3],"origin":{"id":9,"name":"SIIS","link":"http://si-imaging.com","copyright":"© SI Imaging Services (SIIS, KARI, si-imaging.com)"},"images":{"original":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/322/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/322/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/322/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/322/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"parallax":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4_parallax/322/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5_parallax/322/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6_parallax/322/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus_parallax/322/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"original_low_quality":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/322/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/322/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/322/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/322/original_low_quality.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"preview":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/322/aspect_50.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/322/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/322/preview.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/322/preview.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/322/preview.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/322/preview.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"small":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/322/aspect_100.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/322/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/322/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/322/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/322/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/322/aspect_100.jpg","iPad":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/322/aspect_100.jpg","iPad_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/322/aspect_100.jpg"}}},{"id":323,"title":"MexicoCity, Mexico","description":"Mexico City, or the City of Mexico, is the capital of Mexico.

It already delivers plenty of ice to Pine Island Bay—about 79 cubic kilometers (19 cubic miles) of ice per year. But scientists watch this glacier closely because the evidence has been pointing to even faster loss of ice in the future. Such a retreat would lessen the shelf’s buttressing effect, allowing more inland ice to flow out to the ocean, where it ultimately melts and contributes to sea level rise.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/491?s=72105702671fd893dd6bf838160ccac8","created_at":"2017-02-21 09:46:12 UTC","updated_at":"2017-02-21 09:55:52 UTC","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=89638","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","theme_ids":[6],"origin":{"id":2,"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"images":{"original":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/491/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/491/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/491/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/491/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"parallax":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4_parallax/491/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5_parallax/491/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6_parallax/491/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus_parallax/491/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"original_low_quality":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/491/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/491/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/491/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/491/original_low_quality.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"preview":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/491/aspect_50.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/491/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/491/preview.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/491/preview.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/491/preview.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/491/preview.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"small":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/491/aspect_100.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/491/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/491/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/491/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/491/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/491/aspect_100.jpg","iPad":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/491/aspect_100.jpg","iPad_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/491/aspect_100.jpg"}}},{"id":485,"title":"Southern Alaska","description":"Snow and ice covered the land from the coast of the Gulf of Alaska, in the east, to the Bering Sea (west).

Greenish coloration of the offshore waters gives evidence of blooms of phytoplankton – small plant-like organisms which live in the waters year-round, but reproduce explosively when conditions are favorable.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/485?s=b09ec814a30bc9019f037b95471fb846","created_at":"2017-01-15 07:13:44 UTC","updated_at":"2017-01-15 07:25:23 UTC","link":"https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/individual.php?db_date=2016-12-04","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"MODIS","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","theme_ids":[6],"origin":{"id":2,"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"images":{"original":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/485/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/485/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/485/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/485/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"parallax":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4_parallax/485/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5_parallax/485/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6_parallax/485/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus_parallax/485/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"original_low_quality":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/485/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/485/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/485/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/485/original_low_quality.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"preview":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/485/aspect_50.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/485/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/485/preview.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/485/preview.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/485/preview.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/485/preview.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"small":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/485/aspect_100.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/485/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/485/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/485/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/485/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/485/aspect_100.jpg","iPad":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/485/aspect_100.jpg","iPad_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/485/aspect_100.jpg"}}},{"id":442,"title":"Petermann Glacier","description":"In July 2012, a massive ice island broke free of the Petermann Glacier in northwestern Greenland.

Domes on Melville Island","description":"They may look like meteor craters, but the circular features in the surface of northern Canada’s Melville Island actually formed from geologic processes deep underground. These features on the island’s Sabine Peninsula are salt domes, or diapirs. When ancient seas evaporate, they leave behind salt deposits. The salt layers are buried by sediment, which eventually turns into rock. Because the salt deposit is less dense than the overlying rock, it’s buoyant. The buoyant mass of salt balloons upward and intrudes into the overlying rocks through weak spots. The intruding “salt bubble” is called a salt diaper.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/319?s=e1e8350dbf5c4ae08cee67c67dd86b50","created_at":"2016-03-22 11:24:53 UTC","updated_at":"2016-03-22 11:33:42 UTC","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=6871&eocn=related_to&eoci=related_image","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"University of Maryland’s Global Land Cover Facility","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","theme_ids":[6],"origin":{"id":2,"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"images":{"original":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/319/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/319/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/319/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/319/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"parallax":{"iPhone4":null,"iPhone5":null,"iPhone6":null,"iPhone6Plus":null,"iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"original_low_quality":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/319/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/319/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/319/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/319/original_low_quality.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"preview":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/319/aspect_50.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/319/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/319/preview.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/319/preview.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/319/preview.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/319/preview.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"small":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/319/aspect_100.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/319/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/319/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/319/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/319/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/319/aspect_100.jpg","iPad":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/319/aspect_100.jpg","iPad_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/319/aspect_100.jpg"}}},{"id":320,"title":"Dragon Lake, Siberia","description":"Nicknamed “Dragon Lake,” this body of water is formed by the Bratskove Reservoir, built along the Angara river in southern Siberia, near the city of Bratsk.

The planet’s much thinner atmosphere compared to Earth makes small asteroids less likely to burn up prior to hitting the Martian surface.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/557?s=56f133a972ca010db620b26e8f0b04da","created_at":"2018-03-26 21:43:00 UTC","updated_at":"2018-03-26 22:19:57 UTC","link":"https://www.uahirise.org/ESP_048456_1640","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","theme_ids":[5],"origin":{"id":6,"name":"HiRISE","link":"http://www.uahirise.org","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)"},"images":{"original":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/557/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/557/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/557/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/557/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"parallax":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4_parallax/557/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5_parallax/557/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6_parallax/557/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus_parallax/557/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"original_low_quality":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/557/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/557/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/557/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/557/original_low_quality.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"preview":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/557/aspect_50.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/557/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/557/preview.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/557/preview.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/557/preview.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/557/preview.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"small":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/557/aspect_100.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/557/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/557/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/557/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/557/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/557/aspect_100.jpg","iPad":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/557/aspect_100.jpg","iPad_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/557/aspect_100.jpg"}}},{"id":545,"title":"Ascraeus Mons and Pavonis Mons","description":"The location is between two large volcanos, named Ascraeus Mons and Pavonis Mons, in a dusty area of the Tharsis region of Mars.

It is also too small to be geologically active. There is therefore no way to erase the scars from meteor impacts, except for the generation of new impact craters on top of old ones.\r\n\r\nThis view looks toward anti-Saturn side of Epimetheus. North on Epimetheus is up and rotated 32 degrees to the right.

The grooves shown here, on the side of a large sand dune inside Russell Crater, are the longest linear gullies known, extending almost 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) down this dune slope.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/219?s=557c69827b7b8775c9b5ee254bed1b03","created_at":"2015-11-23 12:21:19 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 20:52:30 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA17260","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","theme_ids":[5],"origin":{"id":7,"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"images":{"original":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/219/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/219/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/219/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/219/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"parallax":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4_parallax/219/original.png","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5_parallax/219/original.png","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6_parallax/219/original.png","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus_parallax/219/original.png","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"original_low_quality":{"iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/219/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/219/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/219/original_low_quality.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/219/original_low_quality.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"preview":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/219/aspect_50.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/219/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone4/219/preview.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone5/219/preview.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6/219/preview.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_iPhone6Plus/219/preview.jpg","iPad":null,"iPad_2x":null},"small":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/219/aspect_100.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/219/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/219/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/219/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/219/aspect_100.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/219/aspect_100.jpg","iPad":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/219/aspect_100.jpg","iPad_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/wallpaper/image_common/219/aspect_100.jpg"}}}]},{"theme":{"id":9,"name":"SIMPLE","description":"The beauty in the minimalist expressions of our planet","sharing_url":"https://itunes.apple.com/app/id991182525","created_at":"2016-08-01 09:53:59 UTC","updated_at":"2019-10-15 15:08:00 UTC","comming_soon":false,"special":false,"unlocked":false,"purchase":{"free":false,"itunes_product_id":"collection.simple","share_to_unlock":false},"bundle_theme_id":"mankind_v1","cover":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/theme/image_cover/9/web_1x.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/theme/image_cover/9/web_2x.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/theme/image_cover/9/iPhone4.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/theme/image_cover/9/iPhone5.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/theme/image_cover/9/iPhone6.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/theme/image_cover/9/iPhone6Plus.jpg"},"cover_small":{"web":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/theme/image_cover/9/very_small.jpg","web_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/theme/image_cover/9/very_small.jpg","iPhone4":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/theme/image_cover/9/very_small.jpg","iPhone5":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/theme/image_cover/9/very_small.jpg","iPhone6":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/theme/image_cover/9/very_small.jpg","iPhone6Plus":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/theme/image_cover/9/very_small.jpg","iPad":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/theme/image_cover/9/very_small.jpg","iPad_2x":"http://wlppr.cc/uploads/theme/image_cover/9/very_small.jpg"},"counters":{"total":32}},"wallpapers":[{"id":639,"title":"Silverthorne, Colorado","description":"Water and shore in Silverthrone, Colorado, United States.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/639?s=d98b3c843181fcae326fd778b5594693","created_at":"2019-10-15 16:04:17 UTC","updated_at":"2019-10-15 16:06:32 UTC","link":"https://unsplash.com/photos/P6_L4e0I9DI","copyright":"Nathan Anderson","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"N.

The ice shelf is generally smoother than the sea ice, with the exception of the crack—an indication that it is actively growing, according to the MISR team. Project MIDAS, a group in the United Kingdom that has been tracking the rift, reported that the crack grew 22 kilometers (13 miles) over the past six months.
