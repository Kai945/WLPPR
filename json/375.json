{"id":375,"title":"Colourful Naukluft","description":"The National Park includes part of the Namib – the world’s oldest desert – and the Naukluft Mountain range. It is the largest game park in Africa and the fourth largest in the world.\r\nA typical west coast desert, moisture enters as fog, from the Atlantic Ocean, rather than receiving actual rainfall. A phenomenon also found along the coasts of South and North America, the surface water of Namibia’s coast is relatively cold, so that moist air moving in with westerly winds cools and falls as rain before it reaches the coast, allowing only fog to reach inland.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/375?s=3968af2937ab50ba4e2e2ad7ea33d611","created_at":"2016-05-17 09:49:15 UTC","updated_at":"2016-05-17 09:52:43 UTC","link":"http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2016/04/Colourful_Naukluft","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)","copyright_details":"Modified Copernicus Sentinel data","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"ESA","link":"http://www.esa.int","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)"},"theme":{"name":"WLPPR ORIGINAL","description":"All original collections from WLPPR"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
