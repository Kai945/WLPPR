{"id":209,"title":"Cratered Summit of a Knob","description":"There are many knob formations is the southeastern Acidalia region of Mars. All show a hilltop crest except one which has a summit crater that resembles a cone volcano.\r\n\r\nKnobs like these likely formed from interactions between water ice and lava. For instance, the crater at the top of the center knob is likely from a steam explosion when lava vaporized ice. As such, this summit crater is not an impact crater.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/209?s=bd970237e76f21a7cc6c26365737dbb7","created_at":"2015-11-23 12:12:21 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 20:51:26 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA19131","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"LIFELESS","description":"Desert lands — if you value still and silent beauty of the cosmos"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
