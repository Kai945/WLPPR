{"id":608,"title":"Glowing Southern Lights","description":"This false-color composite image, constructed from data obtained by NASA's Cassini spacecraft, shows the glow of auroras streaking out about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) from the cloud tops of Saturn's south polar region. It is among the first images released from a study that identifies images showing auroral emissions out of the entire catalogue of images taken by Cassini's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/608?s=ce99ceacc9a72afdf88d96006f182354","created_at":"2019-10-15 12:16:59 UTC","updated_at":"2019-10-15 14:41:52 UTC","link":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA13402","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"RAW","description":"Beauty of the science"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
