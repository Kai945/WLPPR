{"id":141,"title":"Mexico City","description":"The area pictured lies within central Mexico’s highlands plateau called the Valley of Mexico. This valley was originally covered by the waters of Lake Texcoco but over the centuries the water has been drained. The area that has not been built up is today used for hydraulic management and is made up of reservoirs and ponds such as the large, dark Nabor Carrillo lake pictured here.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/141?s=76b2ff1faa1c50b574bfd76e13634d95","created_at":"2015-10-02 14:35:41 UTC","updated_at":"2015-12-04 23:05:26 UTC","link":"http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2014/07/Mexico_City","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)","copyright_details":"KARI.","origin":{"name":"ESA","link":"http://www.esa.int","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)"},"theme":{"name":"MANKIND","description":"Traces of human presence on once virgin lands"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
