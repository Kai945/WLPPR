{"id":186,"title":"Prince Patrick Island, Canada","description":"Prince Patrick Island is located in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and is the westernmost Elizabeth Island in the Northwest Territories of Canada. The island is underlain by sedimentary rocks, cut by still-active faults. The streams follow a dendritic drainage system: there are many contributing streams (analogous to the twigs of a tree), which are then joined together into the tributaries of the main river (the branches and the trunk of the tree, respectively). They develop where the river channel follows the slope of the terrain.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/186?s=880697e9df511a8402c86cc1e22d4a1b","created_at":"2015-11-10 09:38:05 UTC","updated_at":"2015-12-04 23:05:26 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA19222","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"NASA/GSFC/METI/ERSDAC/JAROS, and U.S./Japan ASTER Science Team","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"WLPPR ORIGINAL","description":"All original collections from WLPPR"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
