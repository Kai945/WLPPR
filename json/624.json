{"id":624,"title":" Zeta Ophiuchi","description":"The giant star Zeta Ophiuchi is having a \"shocking\" effect on the surrounding dust clouds in this infrared image from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. Stellar winds flowing out from this fast-moving star are making ripples in the dust as it approaches, creating a bow shock seen as glowing gossamer threads, which, for this star, are only seen in infrared light.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/624?s=2e44f38c4c77fe06257f503e8e1aed42","created_at":"2019-10-15 15:30:23 UTC","updated_at":"2019-10-15 15:31:08 UTC","link":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA16604","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"UNIVERSE","description":"All of time and space and its contents"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
