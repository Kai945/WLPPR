{"id":468,"title":"Orion Nebula","description":"This dramatic image offers a peek inside a 'cavern' of dust and gas where thousands of stars are forming. The image, taken by the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, represents the sharpest view ever taken of this region, called the Orion Nebula. More than 3000 stars of various sizes appear in this image. Some of them have never been seen in visible light.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/468?s=769072a7b1fbb91331071d584b591480","created_at":"2016-12-01 16:53:01 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 21:01:12 UTC","link":"http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2006/01/Hubble_s_sharpest_view_of_the_Orion_Nebula","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)","copyright_details":"NASA, JPL, Hubble Team","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"ESA","link":"http://www.esa.int","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)"},"theme":{"name":"UNIVERSE","description":"All of time and space and its contents"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
