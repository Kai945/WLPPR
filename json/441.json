{"id":441,"title":"Making Waves in the Sky off of Africa","description":"Off of west Africa, dry air coming off the Namib desert—after being cooled by the night—moves out under the balmy, moist air over the ocean and bumps it upwards. As the humid air rises to a higher altitude, the moisture condenses into droplets, forming clouds. Gravity rolls these newly formed clouds into a wave-like shape. When moist air goes up, it cools, and then gravity pushes it down again. As it plummets toward the earth, the moist air is pushed up again by the dry air. Repeated again and again, this process creates gravity waves.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/441?s=271dcb1b153fc7d9ceba1352e841e938","created_at":"2016-08-29 09:39:42 UTC","updated_at":"2016-08-29 09:42:50 UTC","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=88296","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"WATER","description":"Something special that holds all life together"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
