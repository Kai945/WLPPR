{"id":275,"title":"Prado Dam","description":"2005: Heavy rain hammered Southern California through much of January. This time, for a few brief days, the Santa Ana River was once again feared. On January 14, workers spotted a small leak on the Prado Dam. The dam had been under construction as part of an expansion project, and growing damp spots were found on the front of the dam in an area where new outlet gates were being built. Corona city officials evacuated over 800 homes below the dam while the U.S. Corp of Engineers inspected the dam and repaired the damage.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/275?s=c99787c8720daed271cb35848a2b2853","created_at":"2015-12-09 13:20:12 UTC","updated_at":"2016-03-30 09:27:55 UTC","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=5195&eocn=related_to&eoci=related_image","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"IKONOS, GeoEye, and Digital Globe imagery must be coordinated with Digital Globe.","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"MANKIND","description":"Traces of human presence on once virgin lands"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
