{"id":488,"title":"Crater Dunes and Gullies","description":"Gullies are relatively common features in the steep slopes of crater walls, possibly formed by dry mass movement, movement of carbon dioxide frost, or perhaps the melting of ground ice. \r\n\r\nThis example shows a section of crater wall from the rocky crater rim at the far left of the image, down to the dark dusty dunes on the crater floor in the bottom right. (North is to the left.) The rock of the crater walls shows up deep orange, and the sandy deposits on the crater floor and the base of the crater walls appear blue. The sand isn’t really blue; the different colors in this image represent different material compositions.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/488?s=418cf26125d9fbe3c057adf148e85213","created_at":"2017-02-21 09:40:34 UTC","updated_at":"2017-02-21 09:55:29 UTC","link":"http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_020957_1290","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"HiRISE","link":"http://www.uahirise.org","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)"},"theme":{"name":"MARS","description":"The Red Planet, one of the most desirable destinations for humanity"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
