{"id":319,"title":"Salt Domes on Melville Island","description":"They may look like meteor craters, but the circular features in the surface of northern Canada’s Melville Island actually formed from geologic processes deep underground. These features on the island’s Sabine Peninsula are salt domes, or diapirs. When ancient seas evaporate, they leave behind salt deposits. The salt layers are buried by sediment, which eventually turns into rock. Because the salt deposit is less dense than the overlying rock, it’s buoyant. The buoyant mass of salt balloons upward and intrudes into the overlying rocks through weak spots. The intruding “salt bubble” is called a salt diaper.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/319?s=e1e8350dbf5c4ae08cee67c67dd86b50","created_at":"2016-03-22 11:24:53 UTC","updated_at":"2016-03-22 11:33:42 UTC","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=6871&eocn=related_to&eoci=related_image","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"University of Maryland’s Global Land Cover Facility","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"WINTER","description":"Special gallery to set the mood for snowy days"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
