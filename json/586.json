{"id":586,"title":"Dione","description":"Saturn's moon Dione drifts before the planet's rings, seen here almost edge on. For all their immense width, the rings are relatively paper-thin, about 30 feet (10 meters) in most places. For its part, Dione is about 698 miles (1,123 kilometers) across.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/586?s=b90a65e6959c8e75a5fcbb6fcd763cb7","created_at":"2018-12-24 12:50:48 UTC","updated_at":"2018-12-24 13:23:36 UTC","link":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA17219","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"PLANETS","description":"All those huge things"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
