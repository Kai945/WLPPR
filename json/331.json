{"id":331,"title":"Deep blue Red Sea reefs","description":"This beautiful true-colour image features the Red Sea coral reefs off the coast of Saudi Arabia.\r\nThis vast, desolate area in the very northern corner of the Red Sea is bordered by the Hejaz Mountains to the east. The area was once criss-crossed by ancient trade routes that played a vital role in the development of many of the region’s greatest civilisations.\r\nToday, the Red Sea separates the coasts of Egypt, Sudan and Eritrea to the west from those of Saudi Arabia and Yemen to the east.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/331?s=32cf4c7d44e6d884b1d65a26c46c8ba2","created_at":"2016-03-29 11:05:42 UTC","updated_at":"2016-03-29 11:05:42 UTC","link":"http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2015/10/Deep_blue_Red_Sea_reefs","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)","copyright_details":"Copernicus Sentinel data.","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"ESA","link":"http://www.esa.int","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)"},"theme":{"name":"WATER","description":"Something special that holds all life together"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
