{"id":253,"title":"Tassili n’Ajjer National Park","description":"Tassili n’Ajjer National Park covers 72,000 square kilometers (27,800 square miles) in southeastern Algeria. Part of the Sahara Desert, the park has a bone-dry climate with scant rainfall, yet does not blend in with Saharan dunes. Instead, the rocky plateau rises above the surrounding sand seas. Rich in geologic and human history, Tassili n’Ajjer is a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/253?s=c05162e2459cf51ffff790d4f4260c24","created_at":"2015-12-01 11:58:28 UTC","updated_at":"2016-03-30 09:13:23 UTC","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=49864&eocn=image&eoci=moreiotd","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"FALSE – COLOR","description":"Satellites show what human eyes can't see"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
