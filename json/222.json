The smooth expanse of the informally named icy plain Sputnik Planum (right) is flanked to the west (left) by rugged mountains up to 11,000 feet (3,500 meters) high, including the informally named Norgay Montes in the foreground and Hillary Montes on the skyline.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/222?s=4766db3d8af963e7c35ba36e0d7dbec6","created_at":"2015-11-23 15:29:16 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 20:51:55 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA19948","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Southwest Research Institute","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"LIFELESS","description":"Desert lands — if you value still and silent beauty of the cosmos"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
