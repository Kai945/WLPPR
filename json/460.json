{"id":460,"title":"Infrared Orion Nebula","description":"This infrared image from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope shows the Orion nebula, our closest massive star-making factory, 1,450 light-years from Earth. The nebula is close enough to appear to the naked eye as a fuzzy star in the sword of the popular hunter constellation.\r\nThe nebula itself is located on the lower half of the image, surrounded by a ring of dust. It formed in a cold cloud of gas and dust and contains about 1,000 young stars. These stars illuminate the cloud, creating the beautiful nebulosity, or swirls of material, seen here in infrared.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/460?s=d4b220785a118f08d1573776d0cc4847","created_at":"2016-12-01 16:21:27 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 21:00:00 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA08653","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"Univ. of Toledo","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"UNIVERSE","description":"All of time and space and its contents"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
