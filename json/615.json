{"id":615,"title":"Solar Wind","description":"A very strong interaction occurs between the solar wind (horizontal red bands to left and right in figure) and the comet's surrounding cloud of dust and gas, the coma. Near Deep Space 1's closest approach to the nucleus, the solar wind picked up charged water molecules from the coma (upper green band near the center), slowing the wind sharply and creating the V-shaped energy structure at the center.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/615?s=24cfe3936f885b0a5e3aa4805622b66f","created_at":"2019-10-15 12:29:16 UTC","updated_at":"2019-10-15 14:42:22 UTC","link":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA03502","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"RAW","description":"Beauty of the science"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
