{"id":149,"title":"Songhua River","description":"Northeastern China’s Songhua River flows northward out of the Changbai Mountains and cuts across the Manchurian Plain before emptying into the Amur River, which separates northeastern China from Russia’s Far East. As China’s northernmost river system, the Songhua is an important artery for transporting agricultural products grown on the plain. On its way, the river flows past Harbin, the capital of China’s Heilongjiang Province, where it is the source of drinking water for several million people.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/149?s=1a653b013de8000885b5dc336990ebd6","created_at":"2015-10-25 21:54:46 UTC","updated_at":"2015-12-04 23:05:26 UTC","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=6139&eocn=image&eoci=related_image","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"GSFC/METI/ERSDAC/JAROS, and U.S./Japan ASTER Science Team.","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"MANKIND","description":"Traces of human presence on once virgin lands"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
