{"id":61,"title":"Cal Madow mountain range, Somalia","description":"In contrast to the sparsely-vegetated majority of the country – typical of its semi-arid to arid climate – the mountain range is densely forested. In this image, the vegetated areas appear much darker.\r\n\r\nThe ecologically diverse region is home to a number of endemic plants species, as well as many rare animals. Unfortunately, the area lacks proper conservation and is threatened by deforestation and intensive livestock grazing.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/61?s=14389219ca5caffc3fc9eadc3d5f6525","created_at":"2015-07-30 21:27:14 UTC","updated_at":"2015-12-04 23:05:25 UTC","link":"http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2014/07/Cal_Madow_mountain_range_Somalia","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)","copyright_details":"JAXA.","origin":{"name":"ESA","link":"http://www.esa.int","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)"},"theme":{"name":"WLPPR ORIGINAL","description":"All original collections from WLPPR"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
