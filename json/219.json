{"id":219,"title":"Linear Gullies Inside Russell Crater","description":"Several types of downhill flow features have been observed on Mars. This image is an example of a type called \"linear gullies.\" Linear gullies are characterized by relatively constant width and by raised banks or levees along the sides. Unlike gullies caused by water-lubricated flows on Earth and possibly on Mars, they don't have aprons of debris at the downhill end of the channel. The grooves shown here, on the side of a large sand dune inside Russell Crater, are the longest linear gullies known, extending almost 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) down this dune slope.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/219?s=557c69827b7b8775c9b5ee254bed1b03","created_at":"2015-11-23 12:21:19 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 20:52:30 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA17260","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"LIFELESS","description":"Desert lands — if you value still and silent beauty of the cosmos"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
