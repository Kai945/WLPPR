{"id":463,"title":"North America Nebula","description":"This swirling landscape of stars is known as the North America nebula. In visible light, the region resembles North America, but in this new infrared view from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, the continent disappears.\r\nWhere did the continent go? The reason you don't see it in Spitzer's view has to do, in part, with the fact that infrared light can penetrate dust whereas visible light cannot. Dusty, dark clouds in the visible image become transparent in Spitzer's view. In addition, Spitzer's infrared detectors pick up the glow of dusty cocoons enveloping baby stars.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/463?s=0a65c38c88ec166131a140ec6714aac0","created_at":"2016-12-01 16:31:57 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 21:00:28 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA13844","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"UNIVERSE","description":"All of time and space and its contents"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
