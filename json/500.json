{"id":500,"title":"Grounded in the Caspian Sea","description":"Natural-color images that beautifully demonstrate the variety of ice types that can form in the northern Caspian Sea. The Caspian stretches about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) from Kazakhstan to Iran. In the north, temperatures are colder, and the water is fresher (less saline) and shallower. As a result, northern areas are more prone to freezing in wintertime.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/500?s=57bd5d174dc421c191a16badfe10444e","created_at":"2017-04-13 17:22:46 UTC","updated_at":"2017-04-13 17:38:15 UTC","link":"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=89742","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"WINTER","description":"Special gallery to set the mood for snowy days"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
