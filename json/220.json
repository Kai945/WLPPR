{"id":220,"title":"Crater Wall with Sinuous Features","description":"This Dawn framing camera (FC) image of Vesta shows part of a large crater with a relatively fresh rim. The interior of the crater appears much brighter than the surrounding area because this image has been stretched to brighten the interior of the crater. In the original image, the crater interior was originally much darker than it appears now. The most striking feature in this image is the bright and dark material cropping out near the rim of the crater and slumping towards the crater center. This material is rather sinuous in shape.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/220?s=8686f5925b102d0efbea0678b4a1d155","created_at":"2015-11-23 12:22:26 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 20:51:38 UTC","link":"http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/image-detail.html?id=PIA15553","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"UCLA/MPS/DLR/IDA","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"LIFELESS","description":"Desert lands — if you value still and silent beauty of the cosmos"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
