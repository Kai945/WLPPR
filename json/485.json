{"id":485,"title":"Southern Alaska","description":"Snow and ice covered the land from the coast of the Gulf of Alaska, in the east, to the Bering Sea (west). Thin sheets of sea ice had begun to form along most of the coastline and are particularly noticeable along the Kuskokwim Delta, in the west. In contrast, brown sediment fills the waters of the Cook Inlet. Greenish coloration of the offshore waters gives evidence of blooms of phytoplankton – small plant-like organisms which live in the waters year-round, but reproduce explosively when conditions are favorable.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/485?s=b09ec814a30bc9019f037b95471fb846","created_at":"2017-01-15 07:13:44 UTC","updated_at":"2017-01-15 07:25:23 UTC","link":"https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/individual.php?db_date=2016-12-04","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"MODIS","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"WINTER","description":"Special gallery to set the mood for snowy days"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
