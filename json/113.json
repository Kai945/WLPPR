{"id":113,"title":"Nili Fossae","description":"The Nili Fossae graben system, part of which is shown in this image, is an area of great geological interest near the giant Isidis impact basin, northeast of the Syrtis Major volcanic province.\r\n\r\nThe graben system contains numerous troughs, one of which can be seen crossing the lower left of this image. On the plateau above, several depressions can be seen, some of them extending into the trough. A large, 55 km-diameter impact crater with a central pit can be seen on the right.
