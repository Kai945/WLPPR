{"id":524,"title":"Jupiter's Clouds","description":"This image was processed to enhance color differences, showing the amazing variety in Jupiter's stormy atmosphere. The result is a surreal world of vibrant color, clarity and contrast. Four of the white oval storms known as the \"String of Pearls\" are visible near the top of the image. Interestingly, one orange-colored storm can be seen at the belt-zone boundary, while other storms are more of a cream color.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/524?s=6502577794ed2de143ab0cf27b75bb08","created_at":"2017-09-05 09:14:26 UTC","updated_at":"2017-09-05 09:14:26 UTC","link":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA21392","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"PLANETS","description":"All those huge things"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
