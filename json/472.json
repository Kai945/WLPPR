{"id":472,"title":"Stars Adorn Orion's Sword","description":"This image shows what lies near the sword of the constellation Orion — an active stellar nursery containing thousands of young stars and developing protostars.

These massive stars light up the Orion nebula, which is seen here as the bright region near the center of the image.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/472?s=57d8b04e1b5460d148fbec7e0cc85093","created_at":"2016-12-01 17:14:05 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 21:01:44 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA14101","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"UNIVERSE","description":"All of time and space and its contents"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
