{"id":147,"title":"Salt Ponds and Coastal Flats, Western Australia","description":"Coastlines are usually the best indicators for astronauts about which part of the world they are looking at from the windows of the International Space Station. In this photograph, coastal lagoons with numerous rounded islands are typical of the Indian Ocean coastline of Western Australia. These shapes contrast with the angular, white ponds of the salt extraction industry. Low causeways prevent muddy, red-brown inland water (a product of recent rains) from mixing with darker, clearer water near the coast.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/147?s=d5d3642382cf93cc4f8c0e5bc847d96f","created_at":"2015-10-25 20:26:10 UTC","updated_at":"2015-12-04 23:05:25 UTC","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=86238","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"FALSE – COLOR","description":"Satellites show what human eyes can't see"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
