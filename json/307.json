{"id":307,"title":"Tassili n’Ajjer, Algeria","description":"Tassili n’Ajjer, a Saharan mountain range in southeast Algeria, is famed for its prehistoric art and architectural sites. Unlike the Sahara desert of today, this area of the globe was once more habitable and Savannah-like, giving rise to human culture. Since discoveries began in 1910, over 15,000 petroglyphs have been identified, which depict Neolithic human life and animal migrations. The rocky arches and monolithic canyons that define today’s Tassili n’Ajjer range were formed over centuries, and you can distinguish its different rock types, here.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/307?s=4c4524e3fd03aabd4ee2758313e0fb41","created_at":"2016-02-03 13:31:15 UTC","updated_at":"2016-02-03 13:31:46 UTC","link":"http://gallery.urthecast.com/tassili-najjer","copyright":"© UrtheCast Corp.
