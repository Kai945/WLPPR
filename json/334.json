They extend mostly to the south and east of the island, suggesting that the last winds from the storm may have been out of the northwest. The suspended sediments were likely a combination of beach sand and carbonate sediments from around the shallows and reefs.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/334?s=b2fc2e364cae6783c3a73a2869e1b16c","created_at":"2016-03-29 11:12:04 UTC","updated_at":"2016-05-16 21:39:24 UTC","link":"http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=84595","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"WATER","description":"Something special that holds all life together"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
