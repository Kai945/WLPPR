{"id":551,"title":"Janus 2:1 spiral density wave","description":"This view from NASA's Cassini spacecraft shows a wave structure in Saturn's rings known as the Janus 2:1 spiral density wave. Resulting from the same process that creates spiral galaxies, spiral density waves in Saturn’s rings are much more tightly wound. In this case, every second wave crest is actually the same spiral arm which has encircled the entire planet multiple times.\r\n\r\nThis is the only major density wave visible in Saturn's B ring. Most of the B ring is characterized by structures that dominate the areas where density waves might otherwise occur, but this innermost portion of the B ring is different.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/551?s=fbf12c856ef93782d718d5d0134a99be","created_at":"2017-12-05 09:14:30 UTC","updated_at":"2017-12-05 09:28:14 UTC","link":"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/jpl/pia21627/staggering-structure","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"SIMPLE","description":"The beauty in the minimalist expressions of our planet"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
