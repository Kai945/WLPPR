{"id":312,"title":"Eastern Desert","description":"Like most of Egypt’s landscape, the image is dominated by arid desert – namely the Eastern Desert between the Nile River the Red Sea. The distinctive pattern of water erosion from rivers and streams is clearly visible as they make their way towards the Nile, at which point the rolling sandy highlands drop abruptly at the Nile valley, visible along the bottom of the image.\r\nFields of intensive farming along the Nile appear red owing to this false-colour image being processed to include the near-infrared. The varying shades of red indicate how sensitive the multispectral instrument on Sentinel-2 is to differences in chlorophyll content, providing key information on plant health.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/312?s=80e906f2a7d16cb9e8edb921d8e84730","created_at":"2016-03-14 14:05:10 UTC","updated_at":"2016-03-14 14:20:22 UTC","link":"http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2016/02/Eastern_Desert","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)","copyright_details":"Copernicus Sentinel data.","origin":{"name":"ESA","link":"http://www.esa.int","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)"},"theme":{"name":"FALSE – COLOR","description":"Satellites show what human eyes can't see"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
