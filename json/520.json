{"id":520,"title":"Mono Lake, California","description":"In eastern California, along the western edge of the Great Basin, sits Mono Lake. This is a salty remnant of a wetter era. Estimates are that the lake existed for at least 760,000 years. Now surrounded by mountain ranges, however, Mono Lake has no outlet; water entering the lake can only evaporate away, so Mono Lake is saltier than the ocean. South of the lake appear some of the geologic features known as Mono Craters. Geologists estimate that the Mono Craters last erupted about 650 years ago.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/520?s=960c64ac23e038fdee710e302bca3d7c","created_at":"2017-07-29 10:42:59 UTC","updated_at":"2017-07-29 10:57:37 UTC","link":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA21518","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"WATER","description":"Something special that holds all life together"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
