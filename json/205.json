{"id":205,"title":"Methane Painting","description":"This image was taken in a wavelength that is absorbed by methane. Dark areas seen here on Saturn are regions with thicker clouds, where light has to travel through more methane on its way into and back out of the atmosphere. Since Dione (698 miles or 1,123 kilometers across) doesn't have an atmosphere rich in methane the way Saturn does, it does not experience similar absorption.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/205?s=a40dbb0a30b101e1fa342bf1ded41ce6","created_at":"2015-11-23 12:07:18 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-29 20:51:10 UTC","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA18336","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"LIFELESS","description":"Desert lands — if you value still and silent beauty of the cosmos"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
