{"id":505,"title":"In Daylight on the Night Side","description":"NASA's Cassini spacecraft looks down at the rings of Saturn from above the planet's nightside. The darkened globe of Saturn is seen here at lower right, along with the shadow it casts across the rings.\r\n\r\nThe image shows that even on the planet's night side, the rings remain in sunlight, apart from the portion that lies within Saturn's shadow. The rings also reflect sunlight back onto the night side of the planet, making it appear brighter than it would otherwise appear.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/505?s=99736a65fee11e1b9045f51df50dd917","created_at":"2017-06-05 14:34:21 UTC","updated_at":"2017-06-05 15:01:55 UTC","link":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA20505","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"LIFELESS","description":"Desert lands — if you value still and silent beauty of the cosmos"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
