{"id":634,"title":"Alga Crater","description":"The most habitable places on Mars now and in the past are underground, where water is or was much more stable than at the surface and protected from energetic particle radiation.\r\n\r\nLarge impact craters have central rebounds that uplift buried strata from miles below the surface. Often these central uplifts reveal colorful rocks with diverse minerals, including ones altered by prolonged contact with water.\r\n\r\nAlga Crater is located in the southern highlands near a large flood-channel called Ladon Valles. The image cutout shows enhanced (infrared-shifted) color.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/634?s=e0887e892b6e19431c6579223146fb86","created_at":"2019-10-15 15:58:23 UTC","updated_at":"2019-10-15 16:02:19 UTC","link":"https://www.uahirise.org/ESP_060978_1555","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"HiRISE","link":"http://www.uahirise.org","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)"},"theme":{"name":"MARS","description":"The Red Planet, one of the most desirable destinations for humanity"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
