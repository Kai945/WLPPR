{"id":239,"title":"Ice and Clouds in the Bering Strait","description":"Winds from the north pushed sea ice southward and formed cloud streets—parallel rows of clouds—over the Bering Strait in mid-January 2010. The easternmost reaches of the Russian Federation, blanketed in snow and ice, appear in the upper left corner of this image. East of that, sea ice spans the Bering Strait. Along the southern edge of the sea ice, wavy tendrils—newly formed, thin sea ice—predominate.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/239?s=2a3347d57020e109130a97d8e1873220","created_at":"2015-12-01 11:34:50 UTC","updated_at":"2015-12-04 23:05:26 UTC","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=42464&eocn=image&eoci=related_image","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"WINTER","description":"Special gallery to set the mood for snowy days"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
