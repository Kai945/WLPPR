{"id":102,"title":"Flinders Ranges, South Australia","description":"The curving structures that dominate this image are part of a larger geosyncline – a subsiding linear trough in Earth’s crust – that includes the Flinders Ranges. The geosyncline consists of sedimentary rocks in a basin that were folded about 500 million years ago and have been eroded to the current landscape. In this image, the different colours show the different layers of rock.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/102?s=b568cc3ba941775eb05136609abb90c5","created_at":"2015-09-01 08:50:35 UTC","updated_at":"2015-12-04 23:05:25 UTC","link":"http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2013/12/Flinders_Ranges_South_Australia","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)","copyright_details":"JAXA.","origin":{"name":"ESA","link":"http://www.esa.int","copyright":"© European Space Agency (ESA, esa.int)"},"theme":{"name":"WLPPR ORIGINAL","description":"All original collections from WLPPR"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
