{"id":165,"title":"A Fresh Crater near Sirenum Fossae","description":"This impact crater appears relatively recent as it has a sharp rim and well-preserved ejecta. \r\n\r\nThe steep inner slopes are carved by gullies and include possible recurring slope lineae on the equator-facing slopes. Fresh craters often have steep, active slopes, so we are monitoring this crater for changes over time. \r\n","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/165?s=ea8d875535f45a8a48964b66f59ffb74","created_at":"2015-10-27 15:36:06 UTC","updated_at":"2015-12-04 23:05:26 UTC","link":"http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_040663_1415","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)","copyright_details":"","origin":{"name":"HiRISE","link":"http://www.uahirise.org","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)"},"theme":{"name":"MARS","description":"The Red Planet, one of the most desirable destinations for humanity"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":null}}
