{"id":566,"title":"Jupiter","description":"\r\nColorful swirling cloud belts dominate Jupiter's southern hemisphere in this image captured by NASA's Juno spacecraft.\r\n\r\nJupiter appears in this color-enhanced image as a tapestry of vibrant cloud bands and storms. The dark region in the far left is called the South Temperate Belt. Intersecting the belt is a ghost-like feature of slithering white clouds. This is the largest feature in Jupiter's low latitudes that's a cyclone (rotating with clockwise motion).","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/566?s=fd8289d37cb2fdbbc190b56a09299cda","created_at":"2018-03-26 22:14:21 UTC","updated_at":"2018-03-26 22:24:12 UTC","link":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA21974","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"JPL","link":"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov","copyright":"© Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, NASA, Caltech, jpl.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"PLANETS","description":"All those huge things"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
