{"id":636,"title":"Danielson Crater","description":"The rock was formed millions or billions of years ago when loose sediments settled into the crater, one layer at a time, and were later cemented in place. Cyclical variations in the sediment properties made some layers more resistant to erosion than others. After eons, these tougher layers protrude outward like stair steps. Across these steps, the winds have scattered sand (typically appearing darker and less red, i.e. “bluer” in contrast-enhanced color), giving rise to the zebra stripe-like patterns visible here.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/636?s=67942c85486d55611332deeb7fa8203e","created_at":"2019-10-15 16:00:17 UTC","updated_at":"2019-10-15 16:02:13 UTC","link":"https://www.uahirise.org/ESP_060331_1880","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"HiRISE","link":"http://www.uahirise.org","copyright":"© University of Arizona (HiRISE, NASA, JPL, uahirise.org)"},"theme":{"name":"MARS","description":"The Red Planet, one of the most desirable destinations for humanity"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
