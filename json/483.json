Image includes both visible and infrared light, helps distinguish between snow and clouds. Snow is dark red, while clouds are lighter shades of orange and white. How rare was the heavy snow? Parts of the Atacama Desert receive just 1 to 3 millimeters of precipitation per year (the local average is 50 mm, or 2 inches). This storm should skew the averages for some time.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/483?s=5fec52bbb4f88e234101cb81595d903c","created_at":"2017-01-15 07:02:55 UTC","updated_at":"2017-01-15 07:23:27 UTC","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=51312&src=eoa-iotd","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"FALSE – COLOR","description":"Satellites show what human eyes can't see"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
