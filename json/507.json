{"id":507,"title":"Lake Natron, Tanzania","description":"Not many people venture near the shores of Lake Natron in northern Tanzania. The lake is mostly inhospitable to life, except for a few species adapted to its warm, salty, and alkaline water.\r\n\r\nBut you don’t need to visit the lake in person to see its stunning, seasonal color. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 captured these natural-color images of Lake Natron and its surroundings. They show the lake on March 6, 2017, very early in the rainy season that runs from March to May. In these images, you can see the deepest water along the perimeter of the lake bed, the location of lower-elevation lagoons.\r\n\r\nThe climate here is arid. In a non-El Niño year, the lake receives less than 500 millimeters (20 inches) of rain. Evaporation usually exceeds that amount, so the lake relies on other sources—such as the Ewaso Ng’iro River at the north end—to maintain a supply of water through the dry season.","sharing_url":"http://wlppr.cc/sharing/wallpaper/507?s=7c56d06431cfb098e8c291822ed04d7d","created_at":"2017-06-05 14:39:02 UTC","updated_at":"2017-06-05 15:01:01 UTC","link":"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=90191","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)","copyright_details":"","follow_name":"","follow_link":"","origin":{"name":"NASA","link":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov","copyright":"© National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, nasa.gov, earthobservatory.nasa.gov)"},"theme":{"name":"WLPPR ORIGINAL","description":"All original collections from WLPPR"},"image_format":{"original":"png","parallax":"png"}}
